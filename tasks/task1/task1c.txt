c. I am using OCRoutputIndustrial19300006-0001 as testing, for this file, company name the algorithm should produce would be “AMERICAN WINDOW GLASS COMPANY”At brightness setting of 70, my algorithm grabs word sequence [['AMERICAN', 'WINDOW', 'G LASS', 'COMPANY']]
For brightness setting of 1,4, the algorithm was not able to grab any of the word sequence and produced a empty list, at brightness setting of 2,5,8,14,15,19,20,23,24,25,26,28-33,35-41,43-49,51- 99 the algorithm was able to correctly produces the right word sequence, however at brightness setting of 3,6,9,10,11,12,13,16,17,18,21,22,27,34,42,50, the algorithm was able to have the correct company name produces but also have lists that is not a company name which contains single letter etc. Since there is a golden standard for this assignment, error rate is still high for this assignment, I will improve my algorithm by filter out the lists with single letters. One of the problem I am having is that with number and Uppercase let ter combination, using isupper() function in python will return true which cause a problem when it comes down to filter those out.
